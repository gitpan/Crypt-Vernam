Crypt-Vernam version 0.01
=========================

The Crypt::Vernam module allows you to do a simple but robust
encryption/decryption, with the algorithm of Gilbert Sandford, Vernam.
This kind of encryption is truly unbreakable as long the key is
maintained a secret.

The Vernam cipher is a stream cipher where the original/plain data is 
shifted (mod26) or XORed (mod2) with a pseudo-random stream of data of
the same length to generated the encrypted data.
When the stream of data used as key is truly random and used only 
once, it is called a one-time pad. A widely used implementation of the
Vernam cipher is RC4.
